Overview of the TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) notebooks and models

Dataset
*******

Download dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/jhoward/rsna-hemorrhage-jpg 
You can also access it from the slack channel under 'Tools' section, titled 'RSNA hemorrhage JPEGs'.

Images are of size 256x256 pixels


Jupyter Notebooks
*****************

Train_CNNmodel - This notebooks contains algorithms to train a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

Train_PreTraineda - This notebook trains using pre-trained models such as VGG19, InceptionV3 and InceptionresnetV2. Images 
		    resized to 224x224.

Train_Pretrainedb - Same as Train_PreTraineda except Images were resized to 128x128.

TrainModels_kfold - This notebook trains using the stratified k-fold technique using the InceptionV3 and InceptionresnetV2.

EvaluateModels - This notebook evaluates the trained models (see Models folder). 


Models
******

These are the models I trained. See above notebooks for more information on
the models.

***Unable to upload models to github due to very large sizes.

You can access them on this google drive folder at this link:
