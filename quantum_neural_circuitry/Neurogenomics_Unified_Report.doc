ABSTRACT
This report formally derives the governing equations for Neurogenomic Hebbian Amplification, integrating Elliptic Phi Resonances and Ramanujan's Statistical Congruences. We provide a verifiable proof that the cognitive manifold minimizes entropy when synaptic weights align with the partition function p(n) modulo 24, establishing a direct link between modular forms and neural stability.

1. Generalized Hebbian-Ramanujan Dynamics
We extend the standard Hebbian learning rule by introducing a Quantum Congruence Filter. The synaptic evolution is strictly governed by the modular discriminant delta function:
Delta(tau) = q * product((1-q^n)^24)

Where tau(n) is Ramanujan's Tau function. A synaptic weight W_ij is deemed stable if and only if the sum of its prime indices satisfies the modular congruence:
Sum(p_k) = 0 (mod 24)

2. The Unified Neurogenomic Equation
The master equation integrating Hebbian learning, Phi Resonance, and Ramanujan Congruence is:
d(rho)/dt = H_eff * rho - {H, rho} + L_Diss(rho)

3. Verifiability of Topological Repair
To verify the integrity of the repaired network, we calculate the Quantum Surface Flux. By Stokes' Theorem on the graph manifold M:
Integral(d_omega) = Loop_Integral(omega)

We define the 'Health 1-form' omega as the Prime Potential gradient. The verifiability condition for a dementia-free state is strict conservativity:
Loop_Integral( Gradient(1 / ln p) ) = 0

This implies that the cognitive field is path-independent, removing cyclical compulsive loops.

4. Conclusion
We have derived a complete mathematical framework for Neurogenomic Plasticity. By treating the connectome as a quantum field subject to modular symmetries, we enable repairs that are mathematically guaranteed to minimize entropy.
