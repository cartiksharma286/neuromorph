NEURAL CIRCUITRY COMPARISON REPORT
==================================

1. Baseline Models
------------------
- Healthy Circuitry: healthy_brain_schematic.png
  (Dense connectivity, high average entanglement ~0.5)
  
- Dementia Circuitry: dementia_brain_schematic.png
  (Sparse connectivity, reduced entanglement ~0.3, simulating degradation)

2. Treatment Simulation: schizophrenia
--------------------------------------
- Post-Treatment: schizophrenia_schematic.png
  (Disrupted connectivity, reduced coherence loop structures)

3. Advanced QML Repair
----------------------
- Repaired Circuitry: schizophrenia_schematic_repaired.png
  (Recovered optimal connectivity via Quantum Surface Integrals & Continued Fractions)
  
Analysis:
The Advanced Quantum-Statistical Repair successfully re-aligned the network weights, 
increasing global coherence flux and restoring connections to the 'Golden Ratio' optimal flow.
