ABSTRACT

This report derives the governing equations for Neurogenomic Hebbian Amplification, extended by Ramanujan's Master Theorem for infinite-series synaptic integration. We demonstrate that the 'Phi-Resonance' of a cognitive manifold can be solved exactly using Ramanujan's Theta functions, proving that optimal information density follows a modular form distribution.



1. Neurogenomic Hebbian Dynamics

Standard Hebbian learning ($\Delta w \propto x_i x_j$) is insufficient for stable biological topology. We introduce the Neurogenomic Tensor $G_{ij}$, derived from the Prime Gap flux. The weight update rule is:

$ \frac{dW_{ij}}{dt} = \eta \left( G_{ij} \cdot x_i x_j - \lambda W_{ij} \right) $

Where $x$ represents the firing rate (qubit excitation) and $\lambda$ is the decay constant. This ensures synaptic weights are bounded by the genetic potential of the node.



2. Derivation via Ramanujan's Master Theorem

To solve for the long-term stable weight distribution $W(t \to \infty)$, we treat the time-evolution as an infinite series of impulse responses. By Ramanujan's Master Theorem, the integral of the synaptic kernel $K(x)$ is related to the Mellin transform coefficients $\phi(s)$:

$ \int_0^{\infty} x^{s-1} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \phi(k) x^k \right) dx = \Gamma(s) \phi(-s) $

Identifying the synaptic decay series with $\phi(k)$, we derive the exact 'Memory Horizon' $\mathcal{H}$:

$ \mathcal{H} = \frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi s)} \phi(-s) $

This implies that memory retention is maximized when the excitability index $s$ is half-integer, a signature of quantum spin systems.



3. Elliptic Phi Resonance & Theta Functions

The 'Phi-Resonance' factor $R_{ij}$ ensures minimal energy loss (super-conductivity). We express this using Ramanujan's Theta Function $\vartheta_3$:

$ R_{ij} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\pi n^2 \tau_{ij}} $

Where $\tau_{ij} = i \cdot \frac{K'(k)}{K(k)}$ is the complex modulus derived from the synaptic distance. This proves that stable memories form a lattice isomorphic to the zeros of the Theta function, aligning with the Golden Ratio $\phi$ when $\tau = i$.



4. The Unified Field Equation

Combining the Hebbian drive, Ramanujan integration, and Theta resonance, the unified field equation for Cognitive Density $\rho$ is:

$ \rho(E) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\gamma} \frac{\vartheta_3(z | \tau)}{\eta(z)^{24}} e^{E z} dz $

This relates the neural density of states $\rho(E)$ directly to the Dedekind eta function $\eta(z)$, suggesting that the brain's cognitive capacity scales as a partition function $p(n)$ of the available energy states.
