# Advanced MRI Coil Circuit Design & Topology Report

## 1. Introduction
This technical report focuses exclusively on the circuit topologies used in the NeuroPulse high-field MRI system. We analyze the discrete component networks required for resonance tuning, impedance matching to $50\Omega$, and decoupling.

## 2. Standard Birdcage Coil (Quadrature/Linear)

### 2.1 Circuit Topology
The Birdcage coil utilizes a ladder network. In the High-Pass configuration shown below, capacitors are placed on the end-rings, while the rungs act as inductive elements ($L_{rung}$).

### 2.2 Design Equations
For an $N$-rung birdcage, the capacitance $C_{ring}$ required for resonance at $\omega_0$ in the dominant $m=1$ mode is:

    C_ring = 1 / (ω0^2 * L_eq * (1 - cos(2π/N)))

Where $L_{eq}$ is the equivalent inductance of the mesh.

## 3. High-Q Solenoid Coil

### 3.1 Circuit Topology
A solenoid provides the highest possible Q-factor for small volume imaging. The circuit is a simple parallel LC tank with a capacitive divider for matching.

### 3.2 Matching Network
To match the high tank impedance $Z_{tank} = Q \omega L$ to $Z_0 = 50\Omega$:

    X_match = sqrt(Z_tank * Z_0)

## 4. N25 High-Density Array Element

### 4.1 Circuit Topology
Each element of the N25 array is a loop inductor ($L_{loop}$) tailored for high-density packing ($d < 5cm$). The circuit uses a series tune ($C_t$) and parallel match ($C_m$) topology, often referred to as an "L-C-C" network.

### 4.2 Decoupling
Decoupling is achieved via:
1.  **Geometric Overlap:** Critical overlap of $\approx 0.1d$ cancels mutual inductance $M$.
2.  **Preamplifier Decoupling:** The "To Preamp" port connects to a Low Input Impedance Preamplifier (LNA), creating a "virtual open" in the loop, suppressing noise currents.

## 5. Quantum Surface Lattice (Topological)

### 5.1 Circuit Topology
This novel design treats the coil mesh not just as lump elements but as a continuous lattice guiding surface currents. The "Berry Phase" flux loops shown in the diagram provide topological protection against thermal fluctuations.

### 5.2 Flux Quantization
The lattice is designed such that the magnetic flux $\Phi$ through each hexagonal cell is quantized:

    Φ = n * Φ_0 = n * (h / 2e)

This quantization enforces stable current modes even in the presence of dielectric loading shifts.
