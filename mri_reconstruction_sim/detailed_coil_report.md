## 1. Fundamental RF Circuit Physics

### 1.1 Resonance Condition
For any RF coil element, efficiency is maximized at the Larmor frequency. The resonance condition for an LC circuit is derived from the impedance $Z$:
    
    Z = jωL + 1/(jωC)
    
At resonance, the imaginary impedance vanishes ($Z=0$ for ideal theory, or matches source $Z_0$ via matching), leading to:
    
    ω0 = 1 / sqrt(LC)
    f0 = 1 / (2π * sqrt(LC))

For a 3T system (Proton), $f_0 \approx 127.7$ MHz.

### 1.2 Quality Factor (Q)
The Q-factor determines the bandwidth and signal amplification:

    Q = (ω0 * L) / R_eff

Where $R_{eff}$ includes coil resistance ($R_{coil}$) and sample loading ($R_{sample}$).

### 2.1 Standard Birdcage Coil
**Geometry:** A ladder network of 8-32 rungs connecting two end rings.
**Circuit Analysis:**
For a High-Pass Birdcage, the resonant frequencies for mode $m$ are given by:

    ω_m = 1 / sqrt(C_eq * L_eq * (1 - cos(2πm/N)))

## 3. Pulse Sequence Mathematical Derivations

### 3.1 Spin Echo (SE) Signal Equation
The Spin Echo sequence uses a $90^\circ$ excitation pulse followed by a $180^\circ$ refocusing pulse.
**Derivation:**
1.  **Excitation:** Magnetization tipped to transverse plane: $M_{xy}(0) = M_0$.
2.  **T2 Decay:** Signal decays as $e^{-t/T2}$.
3.  **T1 Recovery:** Longitudinal magnetization recovers as $(1 - e^{-t/T1})$.
4.  **Refocusing at TE/2:** Rephases spins to form echo at $TE$.

Combining these, the steady-state signal intensity $S$ is:

    S_SE = k * ρ * (1 - e^(-TR/T1)) * e^(-TE/T2)

Where:
*   $\rho$ is proton density.
*   $k$ is a system constant (gain).
*   $TR$ is Repetition Time, $TE$ is Echo Time.

### 3.2 Gradient Echo (GRE) & Ernst Angle
GRE uses a single RF pulse of angle $\alpha$ and gradient reversal.
**Derivation:**
The steady-state longitudinal magnetization $M_z$ immediately before the $n$-th pulse is:

    M_z(pre) = M0 * (1 - e^(-TR/T1)) / (1 - cos(α) * e^(-TR/T1))

The transverse signal generated is $M_{xy} = M_z(pre) \sin(\alpha)$. Adding $T2^*$ decay:

    S_GRE = k * ρ * sin(α) * (1 - e^(-TR/T1)) * e^(-TE/T2*) / (1 - cos(α) * e^(-TR/T1))

**Optimization (Ernst Angle):**
To maximize $S_{GRE}$ with respect to $\alpha$, we set $dS/d\alpha = 0$, leading to:

    cos(α_Ernst) = e^(-TR/T1)

### 3.3 Quantum Entangled Sequence
**Noise Model:**
Standard thermal noise voltage $V_n \propto \sqrt{4k_B T R \Delta f}$.
In the quantum regime, utilizing entangled states allows us to operate below the standard quantum limit (SQL).
Signal term with Entanglement parameter $\xi$:

    S_Quantum = S_Standard / sqrt(1 - ξ)

Where $\xi \to 1$ implies perfect noise cancellation via quantum correlation.
