STOP! READ THIS FIRST.

You have requested to "Publish to the iPhone App Store".
Because Xcode is not installed on this machine, I have prepared this **Source Code Package** for you to upload to a Cloud Build Service.

INSTRUCTIONS TO PUBLISH:

1.  **Create an Account**: Go to https://ionic.io/appflow (or use PhoneGap Build / Expo).
2.  **Upload**: Upload this entire zip file (`ios_submission.zip`).
3.  **Configure**:
    *   Framework: Capacitor
    *   Platform: iOS
    *   Build Type: App Store
4.  **Signing**: You will be asked to upload your Apple Developer Certificate (.p12) and Provisioning Profile.
    *   Get these from: https://developer.apple.com/account
5.  **Submit**: Once the build completes, the service will "Deploy to App Store Connect".

This is the standard industry workflow for publishing without local Mac hardware.
